Changes made:
I removed the fixed ports for the frontend and backend from the docker-compose.yml. Now they are no longer directly accessible. Here's the port scan:

$ docker compose up

$ docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost
    Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-05-10 09:49 UTC
    Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
    Host is up (0.0000030s latency).
    Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
